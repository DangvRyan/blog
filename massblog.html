                Massasoit Material
            </h1>
            <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/thumbs/massthumb.png">
            <p>While attending Massasoit Community College in 2023, I was referred by my professor to design promotional 
                material for an Open House. The Open House commemorated the reopening of Massasoit's newly renovated Television Studio. 
                This would mark the first time I would follow an official branding graphic manual, but, luckily, I had experience with the concept from working on 
                my Meals on Wheels rebranding project.
            </p>
            <h3>Creativity in a Time Crunch</h3>
            <div class="flex">
                <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/portpics/mass5.png">
                <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/portpics/mass6.png">
            </div>
            <p>I took great care in following Massasoit's visual standards, including color choice, language, and typography. I was able to create a series of
                serviceable "generic" designs that followed a similar visual language to present to my supervisor. To be fair, time was of the essence,
                but through the use of shape and line I was able to present several distinct variations for their invitations and flyers. I tried to keep in mind
                the importance of visual hierarchy and negative space, but I'm sure my professors would laud my choice to present a center-aligned poster as a cliche
                choice for typographic invitations.
            </p>
            <h3>The Eye-Catcher</h3>
            <div class="flex">
                <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/portpics/mass1.png">
                <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/portpics/mass8.png">
            </div>
            <p>Though I was performing in a time crunch, all it took was one good idea to make them happy to have my help. I just had to make a reference to
                the theme of the event, otherwise there would be nothing separating me from any other designer. By taking the theme and pushing it as an
                organizational element, I justify my position as a freelance designer.
