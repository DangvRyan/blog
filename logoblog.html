                Personal Branding
            </h1>
            <img class="blogthumb" src="assets/thumbs/logothumb.png">
            <p>In an attempt to capture my personal identity as a designer, I started working on an effective logo design to use across my personal
                design material. The goal was to simply incorporate my name in an easy to read and memorable icon. I began with a geometric circle, and I
                built around it using the letterforms "D" for Dang and "R" for Ryan. Some would advise against using a perfect circle, as Google's iconic "G" proposes
                visual balance through overshooting its shape. I, however, see no need to revamp my own logo, perhaps through laziness, but moreso because the
                effects of such a change would be quite minimal.
            </p>
            <h3>Fun Animation</h3>

            </div>
            <p>With a geometric logo and a dream, I started learning Adobe After Effects to bring my logo to life. It was a fun experiment in breaking
                down my logo and animating each piece separately. I am especially proud of the orange splash, as it is my first time doing
                keyframe Animation. It is akin to learning how to walk. I am still a beginner in After Effects, but this logo is my first step into the fray.
            </p>
            <h3>Put it in Print</h3>

            <p>One of my favorite school projects was my portfolio package design. It was meant to be a mailable package to potential employers,
                but I have yet to send it out. Still, it acts as a trophy for me. I designed a dieline for the package that incorporated my logo, resume,
                portfolio work, and business card. The only misstep was how the printer turned my lovely seagreen into a dark blue. Beggars cannot be choosers,
                so I still appreciate the opportunity to solidify my branding in this creative and sturdy package.
